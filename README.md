This project aims to accurately classify underwater objects—specifically distinguishing between rocks and mines—using sonar signal data. Utilizing Python and supervised machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the system is trained on labeled sonar datasets to identify patterns in acoustic reflections.
